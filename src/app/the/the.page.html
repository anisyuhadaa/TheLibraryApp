          <p> <b> Summary</b> </p>
          <p>June Jones emerges from her shell to fight for her beloved local library, and through the efforts and support
             of an eclectic group of library patrons, she discovers life-changing friendships along the way. </p>

          <p>Lonely librarian June Jones has never left the sleepy English village where she grew up. Shy and reclusive,
             the thirty-year-old would rather spend her time buried in books than venture out into the world. But when her
             library is threatened with closure, June is forced to emerge from behind the shelves to save the heart of her 
             community and the place that holds the dearest memories of her mother.</p>

          <p>Joining a band of eccentric yet dedicated locals in a campaign to keep the library, June opens herself up to
             other people for the first time since her mother died. It just so happens that her old school friend Alex Chen 
             is back in town and willing to lend a helping hand. The kindhearted lawyer's feelings for her are obvious to 
             everyone but June, who won't believe that anyone could ever care for her in that way.</p>

          <p>To save the place and the books that mean so much to her, June must finally make some changes to her life. 
            For once, she's determined not to go down without a fight. And maybe, in fighting for her cherished library, 
            June can save herself, too.</p>
